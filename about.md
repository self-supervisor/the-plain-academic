title: About
---

I hold a degree in physics from UCL. During my undergraduate degree, I received a Royal Astronomical Society 
research bursary to apply machine learning to cosmology at the **Mullard Space Science Laboratory** with Prof. Tom Kitching.
Additionally, I worked as a **bioinformatics** intern for **Illumina**, where I developed deep learning approaches for genomic analysis.
In my final year I worked with Prof. Ofer Lahav, again applying deep learning to cosmology. I have also previously worked 
at **Kagenova** as a **Machine Learning Research Scientist** developing geometric deep learning approaches. 

I am currently a second year computer science PhD student on the foundational AI CDT at UCL, where I am working 
with Lewis Griffin and Caswell Barry developing supervision efficient machine learning algorithms, often based on 
models of the mammalian brain. Specifically, I work on sparse reward reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning.
