I am currently a PhD student at UCL. I work with [Caswell Barry](https://barry-lab.com/), [Lewis Griffin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Gw5Pc1UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Tony Zador](https://zadorlab.labsites.cshl.edu/). I have worked on reinforcement learning, interpreting large language models and geometric deep learning. I like to use Neuroscience as an inspiration to build better ML algorithms.

During my PhD I have interned at [**Rewood Research**](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/) in Berkeley California for the REMIX program, at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory) with [Anthony Zador](https://zadorlab.labsites.cshl.edu/), at Oxford University with [Clare Lyle](https://clarelyle.com/) and at [CopernicAI](https://copernicai.com/) with [Jason McEwen](http://www.jasonmcewen.org/).

Before that I did an MSci degree in physics at UCL. During my MSci, I received a Royal Astronomical Society 
research bursary to apply machine learning to cosmology at the **Mullard Space Science Laboratory** with [Tom Kitching](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YoFoNiAAAAAJ&hl=en).
Additionally, I worked as a **bioinformatics** intern for [**Illumina**](illumina.com), where I developed deep learning approaches for genomic analysis. In my final year I worked with [Ofer Lahav](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjP6PvoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), again applying deep learning to cosmology.
